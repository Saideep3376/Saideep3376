## Hey there 👋

I’m **Sri Sai Deep Duduka**, a final-year B.Tech student in **Electronics & Computer Engineering** with a strong interest in **robotics, embedded systems, and controls**.

<!-- I like building systems where hardware and software actually talk to each other—cleanly, reliably, and without magic smoke escaping. -->

---

## 🚧 What I’m currently working on

- ESP Based PLCs
- Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) 
- Embedded firmware using **ESP32, Raspberry Pi Pico, and Arduino**
- CAN, UART, I2C based communication system

I enjoy projects that live at the intersection of **electronics, code, and real-world constraints**.

I’m always happy to talk about robotics, embedded systems, research ideas, or just cool engineering problems.
